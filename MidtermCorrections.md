# Midterm corrections


### Question 16: If the features are standardized, the correlations from the previous question do not change.

Prior to standardization to the correlation value between House Age for example and House Value was 0.105623.  
After standardizing the data the correlation value was -0.119034, thus there was a significant change.

#### Correction: 
The reason for the original error was that I standardized the entire data set using ss.fit_transform, including my target variable, thus I did not get this result.  

### Question 18: Linear Regression w a K-Fold

Prior to standardization to the correlation value between House Age for example and House Value was 0.105623.  
After standardizing the data the correlation value was -0.119034, thus there was a significant change.

#### Correction:
