# Project 1

### Question 1
#### Describe continuous, ordinal and nominal data. Provide examples of each. Describe a model of your own construction that incorporates variables of each type of data. You are perfectly welcome to describe your model using english rather than mathematical notation if you prefer. Include hypothetical variables that represent your features and target.

Continous data: can take on any numerical value and can be broken down into parts and retain its significance (like meters to milimeters). Examples could be time in seconds, weight of an object, etc...  

Ordinal data: variables have numerical values and are ranked. Here the order of variables matters, but not the magnitudes of their differences (thus cannot be further subdivided). Examples would include a 1-5 feeling thermometer data (Not likely at all to Very likely) or education level.

Nominal data: variables represent categories that cannot be intrinsically ordered and do not have value. Examples would include favorite type of hat or type of dog.

A model that would include all of these data types is measuring the fuel efficiency of cars.
- Fuel efficiency (target/dependent variable) and factors like produced horsepower would be continous
- Number of doors or type of drivetrain (4WD, AWD, Front and Rear wheel drive) would be ordinal
- Body type (sedan, SUV, coupe) or manufacturer would be nominal
